# Sample Commander

Sample Commander is an application designed to assist in organizing audio files, also known as [samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)). 

It is written as an Eclipse plugin but is available as a standalone e4 RCP application.

### Motivation

Sample Commander aims to offer the convenient sample browsing experience provided in modern [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation)'s with an [orthodox file manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Orthodox_file_managers) interface.

It takes inspiration from software such as:

- **FL Studio:** provides a [file browser](https://www.image-line.com/support/flstudio_online_manual/html/browser.htm), a single file tree to view a users sample library. It is convenient for finding sounds to use in a song, but limited in its ability to quickly reorganize the sample libraries structure.

- **Krusader:** A Qt based orthodox file manager. Provides excellent file mangement capabilities and workflow. 

## Features:
- Navigate file directory's quickly with your keyboard

- View multiple directory contents side-by-side

- Supports common file operations (cut, copy, delete, etc.) between directories. 

- Audio playback for .wav, .mp3 and .flac is supported and can be started by selecting a supported file.  

- Git integration to keep track of changes to your audio library
